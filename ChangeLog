Initial release with support for the robust video hash extraction 
algorithm.

0.1 - 08.12.2008

0.3 - 11.03.2008
---
	
10.24.2008 added ph_dct_imagehash() function
	   added ph_dct_matrix() function
	   added dct_image_main() test driver for above functions.
	   added ph_hamming_distance() function
	   added define statements for ulong64 type definition to make sure exactly 64 bits.
10.25.2008 changed ph_dct_imagehash function to use mean 7x7 filter, instead of cimg blur function.
10.28.2008 added ph_dct_video function to phash.cpp to calculate hashes for video files
	   added cimgffmpeg.h with read functions to read video files
	   added dct_video_main.cpp test driver
11.04.2008 fixed dct video hash function - runs faster now

02.03.2009 added audiophash.cpp audiophash.h test_audiophash_main.cpp
	   
03.09.2009 fixed monochrome image support for hash functions (-i.e. if dimension, v of image is
	   3 or greater, converts to grayscale. If v = 1,  uses that plane as a gray scale.);
	   affected functions: ph_dct_imagehash() and ph_image_digest()
