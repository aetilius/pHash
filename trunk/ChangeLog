07.02.2009 include java bindings so pHash can be used from Java programs

	   point is written.
	   added mvptree examples for audio hash 
	   (build_mvptree2.cpp, add_mvptree2.cpp,query_mvptree2.cpp)
	   only one pg size member of mvpfile struct, pgsize
06.22.2009 added text hash functions
06.18.2009 re-added functions for mvp tree hash storage
	   added testfiles: build_mvptree.cpp,add_mvptree.cpp,query_mvptree.cpp
06.16.2009 added functions for mvp tree hash storage.

03.25.2009 added install target to makefile
03.13.2009 added test_imagephash.cpp as a test harness for image phash functions.
	   removed superfluous test targets from makefile
	   added 2 targets to makefile (test_audio and test_image)
	   added test_videophash.cpp as a test for video dct phash functions
	   added "test_video" target to makefile
	
03.12.2009 added test_audiophash.cpp as a test harness for audio phash functions
	   
03.09.2009 fixed monochrome image support for hash functions (-i.e. if dimension, v of image is
	   3 or greater, converts to grayscale. If v = 1,  uses that plane as a gray scale.);
	   affected functions: ph_dct_imagehash() and ph_image_digest()

02.03.2009 added audiophash.cpp audiophash.h test_audiophash_main.cpp

10.24.2008 added ph_dct_imagehash() function
	   added ph_dct_matrix() function
	   added dct_image_main() test driver for above functions.
	   added ph_hamming_distance() function
	   added define statements for ulong64 type definition to make sure exactly 64 bits.
10.25.2008 changed ph_dct_imagehash function to use mean 7x7 filter, instead of cimg blur function.
10.28.2008 added ph_dct_video function to phash.cpp to calculate hashes for video files
