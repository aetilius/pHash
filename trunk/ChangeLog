06.18.2009 re-added functions for mvp tree hash storage
	   added testfiles: build_mvptree.cpp,add_mvptree.cpp,query_mvptree.cpp
06.16.2009 added functions for mvp tree hash storage.
	   removed old mvptree in-mem functions.
04.10.2009 renamed functions and function calls for mvp trees
04.05.2009 added functions for multiple vantage point tree (mvp)
03.30.2009 switch to gnu build system
	   fixed array out of bounds bug in cross correlation function
	   optimized cross correlation function a bit

03.25.2009 added install target to makefile
03.13.2009 added test_imagephash.cpp as a test harness for image phash functions.
	   removed superfluous test targets from makefile
	   added 2 targets to makefile (test_audio and test_image)
	   added test_videophash.cpp as a test for video dct phash functions
	   added "test_video" target to makefile
	
03.12.2009 added test_audiophash.cpp as a test harness for audio phash functions
	   
03.09.2009 fixed monochrome image support for hash functions (-i.e. if dimension, v of image is
	   3 or greater, converts to grayscale. If v = 1,  uses that plane as a gray scale.);
	   affected functions: ph_dct_imagehash() and ph_image_digest()

02.03.2009 added audiophash.cpp audiophash.h test_audiophash_main.cpp

10.24.2008 added ph_dct_imagehash() function
	   added ph_dct_matrix() function
	   added dct_image_main() test driver for above functions.
	   added ph_hamming_distance() function
	   added define statements for ulong64 type definition to make sure exactly 64 bits.
10.25.2008 changed ph_dct_imagehash function to use mean 7x7 filter, instead of cimg blur function.
10.28.2008 added ph_dct_video function to phash.cpp to calculate hashes for video files
	   added cimgffmpeg.h with read functions to read video files
	   added dct_video_main.cpp test driver
11.04.2008 fixed dct video hash function - runs faster now
