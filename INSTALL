Basic Configuration
==================

This project uses CMake to manage project configuration. By default
it builds pHash as a dynamic library with just image hashing
capability.

To create the default project for your system run `cmake .` in the
root folder of the project. By default it creates unix makefiles.

Optional Configuration
=====================

To build pHash as a static library run
`cmake -DPHASH_DYNAMIC=OFF -DPHASH_STATIC=ON .`.

To include audio hash add `-DWITH_AUDIO_HASH=ON`.

To include video hash add `-DWITH_VIDEO_HASH=ON`.

To include foreign programming language bindings add `-DPHASH_BINDINGS=ON`.

To include examples add `-DPHASH_EXAMPLES=ON`.

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `make; make install' should
build and install this package.  The following
more-detailed instructions are generic.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `cmake .' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `cmake' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

  6. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
     files again.

Compilers and Options
